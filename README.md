# Habitat for Humanity Site Update

I updated this site to make it look modern and added interactive features using jQuery.

## What is Fixed & Added

### 1. New Content
* **Video:** Added a video to the **Advocacy** section (`habitat_video_Web_720.mp4`).
* **Audio:** Added a working audio player for Amy’s stories (`habitat_audio.mp3`).
* **Modern Photos:** Updated the images to look better with rounded corners and shadows. Added missing photos from  **Why We Build** section 

### 2. Cool Interactions (jQuery)
* **Smooth Toggles:** The "Mission," "Why We Build," and "Advocacy" sections now fade and slide in when you click the buttons.
* **Smart Colors:** The titles change color automatically depending on which section you are looking at.
* **Hover Effects:** Images grow slightly when you move your mouse over them.

### 3. Design Clean-up
* **No More Bullets:** Removed the ugly bullet points from the navigation links to make it a clean, horizontal menu.
* **Modern Layout:** Added a "Glass" effect to the main content box with soft shadows and a sleek background.

## How I organized it
* `index.html` - The page structure.
* `style.css` - The aesthetic (colors, fonts, no bullets).
* `script.js` - The functions (animations and button clicks).
* `/media` - All the videos, audio, and images.
